# Minds Darker
***
Attempts to make [Minds'](https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/subscriptions) dark theme a bit better, which can be toggled by clicking the extension icon.  
This is a chrome based extension that will only work on chromium browsers (Chrome, Brave, etc.). I recommend using [Brave](https://brave.com/).  
It also could be a lot better. The main CSS file(s) will be pulled from this repo without you having to download them every time a change is made. If an update is pushed and you don't see a problem fixed you likely just have to close/open your browser. If that still doesn't work, you'll need to clear your browser cache and then relaunch.  

To install it (since it's not on the webstore):
1. Go to `Settings > Extensions > Manage Extensions`
2. Enable Developer Mode
3. Download the latest release under 'Releases' to the right and unzip it to desired location
4. Click `Load unpacked extension`
5. Select the folder you just made with the `manifest.json` in it
