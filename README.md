# Minds Darker
***
Attempts to make Minds.com's dark theme a bit better, which can be toggled by clicking the extension icon.  
This is a chrome based extension that will only work on chromium browsers (Chrome, Brave, etc.).  
It also could be a lot better.  

To install it (since it's not on the webstore):
1. Go to `Settings > Extensions > Manage Extensions`
2. Enable Developer Mode
3. Download the latest release under 'Releases' to the right and unzip it to desired location
4. Click `Load unpacked extension`
5. Select the folder you just made with the `manifest.json` in it  

Basic preview:
